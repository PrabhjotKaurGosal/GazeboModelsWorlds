# Gazebo-worlds-actors
This reporsitory contains Gazebo worlds and human actors. Some of the models used came with Gazebo when it was installed and some were created from scratch.
These worlds have been tested with Gazebo-11

# Short Description of various worlds
Cafe_actors.world : I used cafe.world file from Gazebo as a starting point and modified it by adding actors and other objects. The actors were later spawned with their trajectories as defined in the world file.
